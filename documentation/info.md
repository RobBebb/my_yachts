## How it was setup

1. Created a new project using the Flutter skeleton.
2. Setup a folder structure based on this web page [Flutter Project Structure: Feature-first or Layer-first?](https://codewithandrea.com/articles/flutter-project-structure/)
3. Updated the localization as per this web page [Simplified Flutter Localization using a BuildContext extension](https://codewithandrea.com/articles/flutter-localization-build-context-extension/)
4. Setup a repository based on [Flutter Apprentice Book Club](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4dBIh1xps-HAaadBRWQobCO_IJ4gMOG2) videos.
5. Using goRouter for the navigation based on the [Flutter Foundation Course](https://courses.codewithandrea.com/p/flutter-foundations-complete) by [Code with Andrea](https://courses.codewithandrea.com/courses/)
## Build Runner

To run build runner I used the following command:

```bash
flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```
